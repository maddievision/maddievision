        Hi, there! I’m Madeline Lim.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can call me Maddie.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m a Filipino trans-girl (she/her), born in Chicago, raised in Sydney (Australia), now living in Los Angeles.
        <a href="https://observablehq.com/@maddievision/where-are-you-from-no-really">I’ve moved around a lot in my
          life.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m a software engineer at <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, a fin-tech company you’ve most likely used in some way.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also run <a href="https://maddievision.com">maddie vision</a>, a music production studio and software services company.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may have also seen me go by the name, <em><strong>DJ Bouche</strong></em>, which has been attributed to some of my early music and ROM hacking work. I still use this name occasionally.
      </p>
      <p>
        I play Beat Saber with a full body tracking avatar. You can catch me streaming on <a href="https://twitch.tv/maddierosetta">Twitch</a>,
        or watch my videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxD4VfO6a28FcPhl7kuuigw">YouTube</a>! 🎶🟥⚔️🟦🎶

        As a musician I’ve worked on projects like the Cartoon Network show, <a href="https://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/ok-ko/index.html">OK K.O.! Let’s Be Heroes</a>. I have also worked on video game projects such as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/vitamin-connection-switch/">Vitamin Connection</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shantae-and-the-seven-sirens/id1451660353">Shantae and the Seven Sirens</a>.

      </p>
      <p>
        In a past life I had extensive experience in the supply chain and third party logistics (3PL) industry where I got my start on the floor on the assembly line and order fulfillment. I would later become a business analyst/process engineer, where I helped in setting up/revamping end-to-end operations in APAC, and new business sales in the telco, tech, and retail industries.
      </p>

        For more details on my professional work, see my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maddievision/">LinkedIn page</a>!
      </p>
      <p>
        In an even more past life, I was active in the ROM hacking community and contributed a number of tools, such as <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/148/">level editor for Super Mario Bros Deluxe (GB)</a> and <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/463/">Pokémon Ruby/Sapphire (GBA)</a>. I specialized in reverse engineer music engines and created a MIDI player for the <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/948/">AGB Music Player 2000</a> engine, used by most GBA games. I still use this name occasionally.
